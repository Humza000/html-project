            <h1 class="listingTitle">Neptune's Hollow
            </h1>
            <p class="listingDescription">This villa caught our eye for its impressive cliffside location, overlooking the Amalfi Coast. Built on three levels, there’s an independent tower on the roof terrace that houses two of the bedrooms, a bathroom and a private balcony. While the tower is more simply furnished than the main house, it gives those staying there privacy. Breakfast is included here for your entire stay, so you can enjoy a leisurely start to the day before relaxing by the pool or sightseeing. And with the popular towns of Positano and Amalfi within easy driving distance, there’s lots to see and do.
